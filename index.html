    <h1>My name is Stephanie</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate cybersecurity student who spends my days diving into the digital world while also working in the dynamic world of furniture sales. Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy a peaceful escape into nature, capturing its beauty through my camera lens. When I'm not exploring the outdoors or getting lost in the art of photography, I'm at home with my husband and our three quirky rescue cats. Together, we bond over video games, anime marathons, and making memories that keep life fun and full of laughter.
