# About Me

## My Interests
My personal interests include video games and immersing myself in a good book during my free time. Recently, I have started exploring photography as a creative escape and a way to unwind. I am eager to learn more about this art and dive into something new. The following websites are a few I have come across during this journey.

## Websites I Recommend
[Nate In The Wild](https://www.nateluebbe.com/)  

  This website belongs to Nate, he started as an avid outdoorsman who wished to live in the moment and capture his travels. His story is inspiring to me. It was not grand of how it started or did he have all the latest equipment. He went forth, learned and adapted. 
  
  Personally, what made my childhood great was being outside and exploring. Looking back I pretended I could take pictures of everything I saw, even though I did not have a camera. The visual memory remained and I always found nature to be fascinating.

[lulu and isabelle studio](https://www.luluandisabelle.com/) 

  This website is Oanh's, this is where she showcases her creative works. From her biography, I can tell it brings her pure joy. I think it is amazing those who set out to do multiple avenues and not limiting themselves to one career or one passion. It shows me to follow the gift of finding something that we find joy in. 
  
  The aesthetic of her art combines design and photography together. I also have a background in Design as well as Sales. Currently I work to help guests reflect their dream room. I believe this is also what attracted me to photography. I believe my appreciation for the subtle details in life is also what attracted me to photography.
