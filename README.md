# About Me

## My Interests
My personal interests include video games and immersing myself in a good book during my free time. Recently, I have started exploring photography as a creative escape and a way to unwind. I am eager to learn more about this art and dive into something new. The following websites are a few I have come across during this journey.

## Websites I Recommend
[Nate In The Wild](https://www.nateluebbe.com/)  

  This website is Nate's, he started as an avid outdoorsman who wished to live in the moment and capture his travels. His story is inspiring to me. It is not grand how it started or having all the latest equipment. He just did it, learned and adapted. 
  
  Personally, my childhood what made it great was being outside and exploring. Looking back I pretended that I could take pictures anywhere I looked even though I had no camera. The visual memory remained and I always found nature to be fascinating.

[lulu and isabelle studio](https://www.luluandisabelle.com/) 

  This website is Oanh's, this is her hobby and her website shows off her creative works. I can tell from her biography it brings her pure joy. I think it is amazing those who set out to do multiple avenues and not limit themselves to one career or one interest. It shows me to follow the gift of finding something that we find joy in. 
  
  The aesthetic of her art brings design and photography together. I have a background in Design as well as Sales. Currently I work alongside to helping guests reflecting their dream room. I beleive this is also what attracted me to photography. I believe my appreciation for the subtle details in life is also what attracted me to photography.
